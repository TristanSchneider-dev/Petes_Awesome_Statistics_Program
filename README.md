# Petes_Awesome_Statistics_Program
The GitHub repository contains a Python program for computing basic descriptive statistics measures. It was inspired by the book "The Art of Statistics" by David Spiegelhalter. The program reads an Excel file and calculates the mean, median, mode, sum, minimum, maximum, range, variance, and standard deviation of the data in the Excel file. The calculated measures are output to the standard output. The repository also includes a placeholder Excel file that can be replaced with your own Excel file.
